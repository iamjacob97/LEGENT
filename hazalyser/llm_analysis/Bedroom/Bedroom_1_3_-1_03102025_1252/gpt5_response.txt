# B) Summary and rationale

The highest risks occur at the wheelchair transfer interface (Risk 15), the rolling ball and carpet obstacles (Risks 12 each), and bed/robot misalignment during transfer (Risk 10). These combine high severity (frail subject, fall risk) with moderate likelihood due to clutter and movable obstacles. Residual hazards include environmental clutter (chairs, tables, safes) and fire/heat sources (candles). Dynamic agents (caregiver, robot) add unpredictable interaction risks.

# C) Safety requirements

1. **Navigation and scene preparation**

   * Enforce ≥0.5 m corridor clearance beside bed, ≥0.3 m dresser clearance.
   * Detect and remove rugs, mats, and football prior to transfer.
   * Relocate side tables and chairs to marked safe zones.

2. **Perception and validation**

   * Pre-task check: wheelchair brakes, footrests, bed height.
   * Detect open flames/candles and abort task if present.
   * Monitor ambient lighting; enable robot’s auxiliary lighting.

3. **Motion and control**

   * Use low-speed omnidirectional drive near subject.
   * Apply redundant torque/force limits on arms and base.
   * Maintain safe workspace boundaries to avoid snagging electronics or tables.

4. **Human factors**

   * Padded grippers and slow approach to subject.
   * Voice prompts before each robot action.
   * Caregiver to supervise with E-stop at hand.

5. **Operational governance**

   * Pre-transfer checklist: clutter cleared, brakes locked, bed verified, E-stop tested.
   * Post-task audit log of near misses and forces for safety learning.

# D) Coverage report

* **Features:** Terrain (floor), surface features (carpets, mats), ambient (lighting), immovable boundaries (walls).
* **Objects:** 0D–3D covered (candles, plates, laptops, tables, safes, chairs, dresser, bed, ball). Hazardous small (candles, food items).
* **Agents:** Autonomous robot (Tiago), humans (subject and caregiver). No animals or automatic agents present.
* **Absent:** Doorways, stairs, windows, external terrain transitions.

# E) Residual risk & SFAIRP

Residual hazards remain in the inherently high-risk wheelchair-to-bed transfer task: force-control faults, subject frailty, and unpredictable human motion. Likelihood is mitigated via robust perception, low-speed control, and caregiver oversight. Residual severity remains high but is reduced to *as low as reasonably practicable* through layered safeguards and pre-task instructions. Under SFAIRP, the task is acceptable if checklists, supervision, and environmental preparation are rigorously enforced.
