**B) Summary and Rationale for Identified Risks**

The highest risks (Risk = 15) are associated with the physical transfer of the highly frail subject to/from the bed. A failure here (e.g., misalignment, drop, unexpected movement) could directly cause severe physical injury due to the subject's vulnerability. The second highest risk (Risk = 9) stems from movable objects like chairs and overall clutter, which can create tripping hazards for the subject or obstruct the robot's path, potentially leading to collisions or a failed assistive task. The risk related to the robot itself (Risk = 8) involves systemic failures that could cause a loss of control during a critical operation. Other risks are moderate, relating to collisions with immovable objects or spills of small objects, primarily causing property damage or task failure rather than direct human harm.

**C) Safety Requirements**

1.  The robot must utilize its force/torque sensors to implement strict limits on all forces applied during physical contact with the subject, ensuring they remain below injurious thresholds for a frail individual.
2.  A redundant monitoring system (e.g., combining lidar, camera, and proprioceptive sensing) must continuously track the subject's position and posture during the transfer operation to detect instability or distress.
3.  Path planning algorithms must explicitly account for the robot's manipulator configuration and the reduced mobility of the subject, maintaining larger clearances from all obstacles than in standard navigation.
4.  The control system must include an immediate, hardwired emergency stop function that can be triggered by the subject, a caregiver, or the robot's own safety monitoring systems upon detecting a hazardous condition.
5.  All movable objects identified as potential obstructions (chairs, football, etc.) must be securely stored or explicitly mapped and tracked as dynamic obstacles if they cannot be moved prior to task initiation.

*   **ESHA Classes:** All ontological categories are addressed. The scene contains no stairs, water features, or significant elevation changes. The primary hazards are from collisions, manipulation errors, and interaction with the vulnerable agent.

**E) Residual Risk & SFAIRP**

**Residual Risk:** Even with the proposed mitigations, a non-zero residual risk remains. This is primarily associated with highly unpredictable events, such as a sudden, violent spasm from the subject during transfer or a simultaneous critical failure of multiple redundant sensors. The residual risk for the subject transfer task is assessed as Moderate (Severity 5 * Likelihood 1 after mitigations = Risk 5), acknowledging that the mitigations significantly reduce but cannot eliminate the possibility of a high-consequence event. Other risks are reduced to Low (Risk < 5).

**SFAIRP (So Far As Is Reasonably Practicable):** The analysis demonstrates that the identified hazards have been recognized. The proposed mitigations (force limiting, redundant monitoring, enhanced path planning, emergency stop, clutter management) constitute reasonably practicable measures given the technology available on a platform like the Tiago robot. Further risk reduction would require measures beyond current technical feasibility (e.g., predicting subject spasms) or practicality (e.g., stripping the room completely bare), and thus the residual risk is deemed to have been reduced SFAIRP. The highest residual risk is justified by the necessity of the assistive task and the significant reduction in likelihood achieved through engineering and procedural controls.
