B) Summary and short rationale for identified risks  
The scene is a cluttered bedroom (71.54 m², 1.258 items/m²) with high potential for collisions (e.g., chairs/tables near wheelchair-bed path), tipping (unstable furniture), and entrapment (carpets/small objects). Risks are elevated due to subject's frailty (fall severity 5) and task demands (transfer requiring precise arm/base coordination). Likelihood stems from clutter occlusion affecting lidar (5.6m range limited in dense areas) and movable items. Highest risks: wheelchair instability (20) and bed transfer (15), as failures directly threaten subject injury.

C) Safety requirements  
1. Robot shall detect and avoid all obstacles within 5m using fused lidar/camera data, with >99% accuracy in cluttered environments.  
2. Transfer maneuvers limited to <0.1 m/s speed, with force <10N on subject contacts.  
3. Pre-task clutter clearance: Remove/relocate >80% movable objects within 2m of path.  
4. Real-time monitoring of subject vitals (e.g., via wearable integration) to abort if distress detected.  
5. Emergency stop button accessible to subject/caregiver; verbal/audio feedback for all actions.  
6. Path planning shall ensure >0.5m clearance from edges/tips, validated via simulation.

D) Coverage report  
- Features: Covered (terrain: floors/carpets; ambient: lighting; other: walls). No dynamic ambient (e.g., weather) or stairs/doorways present.  
- Objects: Covered (0D/1D: utensils/food; 2D: mats; 3D immovable: walls/bed/cabinets; movable: chairs/tables/small items; non-agent moving: Absent).  
- Agents: Covered (autonomous robots: Tiago; humans: subject; animals: Absent; automatic: Absent, e.g., no appliances). All classes exhaustive; disjoint via ontological grouping (UFO-AB: physical objects vs agents).

E) Residual risk & SFAIRP  
Residual risks post-mitigations: Low (e.g., wheelchair 20→4 with brakes/sensors; clutter 16→4 with clearance). Overall risk reduced to acceptable (total <50). SFAIRP justified: Inherent designs (padding/stability) and safeguards (sensors/planning) eliminate major hazards; instructions ensure procedural safety. Further reductions (e.g., room redesign) not reasonably practicable given assistive context.
