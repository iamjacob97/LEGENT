# B) Summary and rationale

Highest risks concentrate on: wheelchair brake or footrest misconfiguration during the transfer (Risk 15), rolling ball and rugs that degrade traction (Risks 12 and 12), bed height and mattress compliance mismatch (Risk 10), direct physical interaction errors by the robot (Risk 10), and frail-skin pinch or shear during grasping or support (Risk 10). These combine high severity due to the subjectâ€™s frailty and limited protective reflexes with moderate likelihood given clutter, deformable surfaces, and many movable items close to the bed.

# C) Safety requirements

1. Navigation and scene control
   1.1 Build a semantic map with no-go zones for rugs, ball, plant, lamp, and small table.
   1.2 Enforce approach corridors that maintain at least 0.5 m free width along the bed side and 0.3 m lateral clearance from furniture.
   1.3 Run a pre-task tidy routine that detects and removes low objects and the ball, and tapes or removes rugs.

2. Perception and validation
   2.1 Verify wheelchair brake engagement and footrest position using a force-based push test and vision confirmation before any lift.
   2.2 Measure bed height and estimate mattress compliance; adapt transfer trajectory to maintain center-of-mass over support.
   2.3 Monitor ambient illumination; enable task light and reduce reliance on cameras if glare is detected.

3. Motion and control
   3.1 Use low-speed omnidirectional base mode with contact detection and immediate stop around the subject.
   3.2 Apply dual-channel force and torque limits for arms and base, with watchdogs and a physical E-stop accessible to caregiver.
   3.3 Constrain arm workspaces to avoid shelves, lamps, and electronics; stow arms during navigation.

4. Human factors
   4.1 Use padded, compliant end-effectors and grasp only at approved harness points to avoid skin shear.
   4.2 Provide clear audio prompts before each action and require caregiver confirmation for the commit step.
   4.3 Place anti-slip pad or transfer board as appropriate; ensure bed linens are arranged to prevent sliding.
   4.4 Extinguish candles and unplug unstable lamps prior to transfer.

5. Operational governance
   5.1 Pre-task checklist covering clutter removal, brake and footrest state, bed readiness, lighting, and E-stop availability.
   5.2 Post-task audit logging of forces, stops, and near-misses for continual improvement.

# D) Coverage report

Features: terrain surfaces (floor tiles, rugs) covered; terrain features such as thresholds absent; ambient factors addressed including lighting and reflections; other features include walls and corners.
Objects: 0D/1D/2D items considered such as candles, cables, linens; 3D immovable and movable furniture enumerated. Non-agent moving objects represented by the ball.
Agents: autonomous robot considered; humans include subject and caregiver bystander. No animals. Automatic agents not present. Doorways or stairs are absent and noted. The worksheet covers all present ESHA classes with explicit absence where applicable.

# E) Residual risk and SFAIRP

After implementing the specified inherent measures, safeguards, and instructions, the dominant residual risks are: unexpected human motion during transfer, perception degradation from sudden lighting changes, and force-control failures. Residual severities remain high by nature of the task, but likelihoods reduce to rare or unlikely through engineering controls, pre-task checks, and caregiver confirmation. Given the practicability of the controls relative to the harm avoided, the package meets SFAIRP provided that operators execute the checklist, clutter management is enforced, logs are reviewed for continuous improvement, and the robot is operated within speed and force limits in the transfer zone.
