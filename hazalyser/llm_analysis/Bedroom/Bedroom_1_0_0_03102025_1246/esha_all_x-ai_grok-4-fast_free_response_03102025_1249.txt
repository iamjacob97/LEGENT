B) Summary and short rationale for identified risks  
The scene is a cluttered bedroom (0.697 items/m²) with the transfer path from wheelchair (central-south) to bed (northeast) obstructed by chairs, tables, small objects, and electronics, increasing collision and tipping risks. High-severity risks (S=5) stem from subject frailty (e.g., falls during transfer, Risk=20), exacerbated by clutter occlusion of lidar and movable obstacles. Likelihood is moderate (L=3-4) due to dense layout but mitigated by robot sensors; rationale: Frail subject amplifies minor errors into severe outcomes like fractures, per Rockwood Index.

C) Safety requirements  
1. Robot shall detect and avoid all obstacles within 5.6m using lidar/camera fusion, maintaining >0.5m clearance during transfer.  
2. Arm interactions with subject/wheelchair limited to <0.1m/s velocity and <10N force, with tactile feedback for secure grip.  
3. Pre-task scan to clear path of movable objects (chairs, small items) and hazards (candles, cords); verbal communication mandatory for subject consent.  
4. Failsafe: E-stop on anomaly detection (tilt, high force); speed <0.3m/s overall, <0.2m/s near subject.  
5. Post-transfer verification: Confirm subject stability on bed via sensors/voice check.

D) Coverage report  
- Features: Covered (terrain: walls/floors/carpets; ambient: lighting; other: absent).  
- Objects: Covered (0D: small items like football; 1D: absent; 2D: carpets; 3D immovable: bed/walls; movable: chairs/tables/electronics; non-agent moving: none).  
- Agents: Covered (automatic: absent; autonomous robots: Tiago; animals: absent; humans: subject/player).  
Exhaustive and disjoint per UFO-AB ontology: All scene instances grouped without overlap; non-mission interactions (e.g., ambient shadows) and mission (transfer path) both addressed; absences noted (no stairs/animals).

E) Residual risk & SFAIRP  
Residual risks post-mitigations: Low (max Risk=6-8 for collisions/tips, reduced from 20 via safeguards); transfer failure ~5% likelihood with sensors. SFAIRP: Mitigations (inherent compliant design, lidar safeguards, procedural instructions) balance cost/effort against hazard reduction—exhaustive coverage achieved without over-engineering (e.g., no unnecessary hardware); further reduction impractical given clutter density and subject frailty variability.
