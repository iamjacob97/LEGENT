### B) Summary and Rationale for Identified Risks

High risks (Risk >= 12) are associated with direct physical interaction with the subject during transfer (Risk=15) and interaction with the wheelchair (Risk=12), due to the high severity of potential falls or injuries to the frail subject. Medium risks (Risk=6-8) involve environmental factors like slippery floors, tip-over hazards, and hot or fire-prone objects, where consequences include damage or injury but are mitigated by careful design and protocols. Low risks (Risk=4) are primarily navigation-related collisions with static furniture.

### C) Safety Requirements

1.  The robot must use force/torque sensing on manipulators with strict limits (<5N) during physical contact with the subject.
2.  Obstacle avoidance must maintain a minimum clearance of 0.5m from the subject and wheelchair during navigation.
3.  All paths must be validated for width >0.8m (robot footprint + margin) to prevent entrapment.
4.  Traction control systems must engage on carpeted or potentially slippery surfaces, reducing speed by 50%.
5.  Flammable objects (candles) or hot objects (kettle) must be detected and avoided with a no-approach zone of 1m.
6.  Emergency stop must be triggerable by the subject or remotely, halting all actuators immediately.
7.  Pre-task checks must ensure small objects are stowed and chairs are not in the primary path.

### D) Coverage Report

-   **Features**: Covered (walls, floors, doorways, ambient conditions).
-   **Objects**: Covered (immovable: tables, bed; movable: chairs, small items; receptacles; non-agent moving: none in scene).
-   **Agents**: Covered (human subject, autonomous robot). Animals and automatic agents absent.
-   **Hazard Types**: Collisions (with walls, furniture), occlusion (sensors), tipping (on carpets, contact with lamp), entrapment (doorways), clutter (small objects), movable obstacles (chairs, football), dynamic agents (subject, robot), ambient changes (lighting). All foreseeable classes addressed.

### E) Residual Risk & SFAIRP

**Residual Risk**: After implementing mitigations, the highest residual risks remain in the physical transfer task (Risk reduced to ~6 through force sensing and protocols) and navigation near the subject (Risk reduced to ~4 through clearance rules). Overall, risks are reduced to As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) for an assistive care setting, given the necessity of the task and the state of robotics technology. Continuous monitoring and human supervision are required during high-risk interactions. The balance between risk and benefit (enabling transfer for a frail individual) is justified, with no further practicable mitigations identified without rendering the task non-viable.
