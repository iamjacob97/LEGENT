  "B. Summary": "The scene includes multiple objects (chairs, tables, loose objects like football) that present tripping or collision hazards, especially for the frail subject. The hot water cup introduces slip and spill risks. The robot must navigate and handle objects carefully to avoid these. Most risks are low likelihood but high severity, especially around the subject.",
  "C. Safety requirements": [
    "1. Secure all loose objects (e.g., football, banana peel) to prevent tripping.",
    "2. Ensure the robot's path is clear of obstacles and hazards.",
    "3. When handling the cup, use a stable grip and move slowly to avoid spills.",
    "4. Maintain a safe distance from the subject until ready to hand over the object.",
    "5. Use sensors to detect and avoid small objects on the floor.",
    "6. Have a plan for immediate spill cleanup to prevent slips.",
    "7. Subject's frailty requires extreme cautionâ€”avoid any sudden movements."
  ],
  "D. Coverage report": "Analysis covers all object types (movable, immovable), surfaces (floor), and agents (robot, human). Missing are other environmental features like stairs (none present) or other agents (none). Coverage is sufficient for the task.",
  "E. Residual risk & SFAIRP": "Even with mitigations, residual risk remains due to the subject's frailty and the presence of loose objects. Continuous monitoring is required. SFAIRP is achieved by design (e.g., object securing, slow movement) and procedural controls (emergency stop, supervision)."
