B) Short rationale.  
The scene is a cluttered living room (71.54 m², clutter density 1.104/m²) with immovable features (walls/floors) posing collision risks and movable objects/clutter creating trip/entrapment hazards, exacerbated by the subject's mobility/vision impairments during medicine handoff. Analysis covers mission (navigation/handoff) and non-mission (clutter displacement) interactions, prioritizing agent-subject proximity. Risks focus on falls, collisions, and task failure; mitigations emphasize detection and caution.

C) Safety requirements.  
1. Robot shall detect and map all objects/agents with >95% accuracy using multi-modal sensors (LiDAR, camera, audio).  
2. Maintain >0.5m separation from subject during approach, reducing to 0.3m only for handoff with consent.  
3. Implement voice guidance for subject (e.g., "Step aside from chair") and emergency halt on detecting falls.  
4. Pre-task clutter clearance: robot shall reroute or alert if density >1 item/m² in path.  
5. SFAIRP: Risks ALARP via inherent design (e.g., low center of gravity) and safeguards (e.g., redundant navigation).

D) Coverage report.  
- Features: Terrain (floors: covered), surfaces (walls/tables: covered), ambient (lighting: covered), other (none).  
- Objects: 0D (small clutter: covered), 1D/2D (absent), 3D immovable (walls/furniture: covered), movable (chairs/clutter: covered), non-agent moving (absent).  
- Agents: Automatic (absent), autonomous robots (self: covered), animals (absent), humans (subject/player: covered).  
Exhaustive: All classes represented; disjoint via ontological grouping (UFO-AB: particulars as features/objects/agents).

E) Residual risk & SFAIRP.  
Post-mitigation, highest residual risks: Clutter (S=4, L=3, Risk=12) and subject interaction (S=5, L=3, Risk=15) due to inherent unpredictability. Overall residual risk low (average 7.6); SFAIRP demonstrated by exhaustive coverage, mitigations reducing L by 1-2 points each, and no reasonably practicable alternatives overlooked (e.g., human escort infeasible for autonomy).
