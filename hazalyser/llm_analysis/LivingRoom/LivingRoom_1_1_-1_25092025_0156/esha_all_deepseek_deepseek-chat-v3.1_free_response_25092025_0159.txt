**B) Short Rationale**  
The scene presents a typical indoor living space with high clutter density (1.104 items/m²) containing numerous immovable furniture pieces and movable objects. The primary hazard is interaction with the elderly human subject who has mobility and vision impairments, creating a high-risk scenario for collision. Secondary hazards include tip-over risks with tall objects (lamps, TV), breakage hazards with fragile items (glass, electronics), and spill hazards with liquids/containers. The candle presents a rare but severe fire hazard. The robot's medication delivery task requires careful navigation and manipulation in a constrained environment with potential dynamic obstacles.

**C) Safety Requirements**  
1. Implement human detection and tracking with minimum 1.5m safety distance
2. Use force-limited manipulation for all object interactions
3. Deploy multi-sensor fusion (vision, lidar, tactile) for clutter navigation
4. Establish no-handling policy for open flames (candle)
5. Implement thermal sensing for hot objects (kettle)
6. Use predictive path planning for subject movement anticipation
7. Implement glass/fragile object recognition and special handling protocols
8. Ensure stability control systems for tip-over prevention
9. Maintain continuous environmental mapping for obstacle detection
10. Implement verbal announcement system when approaching subject

**D) Coverage Report**  
- Features: Complete (walls, floors, ambient conditions, doorways implied)
- Objects: Complete coverage (immovable furniture, movable items, receptacles)
- Agents: Complete (human subject present, robot agent present)
- All ESHA classes addressed: Terrain areas/surfaces, ambient conditions, immovable objects, movable objects, non-agent moving objects (none in scene), human agents
- Missing categories: No stairs, no animals, no autonomous robots besides assistive agent, no automatic agents

**E) Residual Risk & SFAIRP**  
Residual risk remains primarily in human-robot interaction (Risk=15) due to the subject's unpredictability and fragility. This is As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) through implemented safeguards (distance keeping, predictive tracking, verbal announcements). The fire hazard from candle (Risk=5) is eliminated by prohibition of interaction. Tip-over hazards (Risk=8) are reduced through stability control and careful navigation. The risk assessment shows that all severe hazards (Severity≥4) have been addressed with engineering controls (sensors, algorithms) and administrative controls (operating procedures), making the system SFAIRP-compliant for the described task and environment.
