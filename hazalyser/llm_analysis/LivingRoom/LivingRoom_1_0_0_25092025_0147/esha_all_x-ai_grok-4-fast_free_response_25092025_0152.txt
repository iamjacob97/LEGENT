B) Short rationale  
The scene is a cluttered indoor living room (120.54m², clutter density 0.639/m²) with flat floors, perimeter walls, furniture, and small movable objects posing trip/collision risks, especially for the elderly subject with mobility/vision impairments during the medicine handoff task. Hazards focus on dynamic interactions between robot, subject, and clutter; no stairs/doorways but high occlusion from furniture. Ratings prioritize subject vulnerability (high S/L for human-related items).

C) Safety requirements  
1. Robot must detect and avoid all movable objects (e.g., chairs, clutter) with >95% accuracy using multi-modal sensors (lidar + vision).  
2. Interaction protocols: Reduce speed to <0.3m/s within 1m of subject; use audio/visual cues for handoff confirmation.  
3. Environmental prep: Clear primary paths of clutter; ensure lighting >300 lux for subject vision.  
4. Fault tolerance: Emergency stop on any collision detection; fallback to verbal guidance if sensors fail.  
5. SFAIRP compliance: Mitigations reduce risks to ALARP via inherent design (e.g., stable furniture) and layered safeguards.

D) Coverage report  
- Features: Fully covered (terrain: floors; surfaces: walls; ambient: lighting; other: absent noted).  
- Objects: Exhaustive (immovable: walls/furniture; movable: chairs/tables/small items; non-agent moving: clutter; 0D/1D/2D: minor/absent; 3D: dominant). Disjoint: No overlaps (e.g., small objects separated from furniture).  
- Agents: Fully covered (autonomous robots: agent; humans: subject/player; animals/automatic: absent noted).  
Total items analyzed: 14 (grouped for efficiency); covers mission (handoff) and non-mission (navigation/clutter) interactions per UFO-AB ontology.

E) Residual risk & SFAIRP  
Post-mitigation residual risks: Highest remains subject interaction (S=5, L=2 post-safeguards, Risk=10) due to human unpredictability; clutter (Risk=8). Overall ALARP achieved: Inherent designs (stable prefabs) + safeguards (sensors/path planning) + instructions (clearance protocols) reduce gross risks >70%; further reductions impractical without redesigning scene (e.g., removing clutter infeasible for realism). SFAIRP justified: Benefits (safe handoff) outweigh costs; no reasonably practicable alternatives overlooked.
