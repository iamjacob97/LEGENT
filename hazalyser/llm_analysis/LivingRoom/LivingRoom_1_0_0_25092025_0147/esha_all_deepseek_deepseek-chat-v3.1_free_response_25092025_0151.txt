**B) Short Rationale**
The scene is a cluttered living space with an elderly, frail occupant. The primary hazards stem from collisions with immovable furniture, interactions with numerous small, movable, and fragile objects (chairs, glasses, food) that can tip, break, or create slip hazards, and navigation around the high-risk human agent. The agent's task (delivering medicine) heightens the consequence of spills or collisions that could prevent task completion or harm the subject. Clutter density and the subject's poor mobility/vision are key risk amplifiers.

**C) Safety Requirements**
1.  The robot must maintain a minimum safe distance (e.g., 0.5m) from the human subject at all times.
2.  The robot must implement a high-priority avoidance behavior for all objects classified as Movable and Fragile.
3.  The robot's navigation system must be validated for operation in low-light conditions equivalent to an elderly person's residence.
4.  The robot must be equipped with a soft-touch bumper and immediate stop functionality upon physical contact.
5.  A policy must prevent navigation underneath tables, benches, or other furniture with low clearance.
6.  The robot must use persistent world modeling to track the location of small, movable objects displaced during operation.

**E) Residual Risk & SFAIRP**
The highest residual risks (Risk >= 9) involve interactions with the human subject (Risk 15) and movable objects like chairs and glassware (Risk 9). Mitigations (safe distances, avoidance, secure storage) reduce likelihood but cannot eliminate the inherent severity of human injury or broken glass. The analysis demonstrates that risks have been identified and mitigated to a level **As Low As Reasonably Practicable (SFAIRP)** given the domestic environment and task constraints. Further risk reduction would require environmental modification (e.g., removing all clutter and fragile items), which is not reasonably practicable for an assistive robot intended to operate in a human-inhabited space. The residual risk is deemed acceptable for the intended operation.
