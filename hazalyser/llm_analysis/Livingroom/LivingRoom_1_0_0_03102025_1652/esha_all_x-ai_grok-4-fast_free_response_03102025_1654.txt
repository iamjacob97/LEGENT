B) Summary and short rationale for identified risks  
The scene is a cluttered living room (151 m², 0.64 clutter/m²) with immovable features (walls/floors), furniture (sofas/tables/chairs), and small movables (food/clothes). Key risks stem from the task: robot must navigate clutter to coffee table ([11.44,0.4,7.61]) for meds, then handover to frail wheelchair-bound subject ([1.26,0.66,5.62]) with poor vision. High risks (12-16) from table tipping (occlusion/clutter), subject collision (frailty), and handover failure (limited mobility). Rationale: Dense layout increases collision likelihood; subject's vulnerability amplifies severity; lidar range (5.6m) covers room but clutter may occlude.

C) Safety requirements  
1. Perception: Real-time 3D mapping with lidar/camera fusion to detect clutter/obstacles >0.95 accuracy.  
2. Motion: Omnidirectional base limited to 0.3 m/s near subject/objects; arm torque <5N.  
3. Interaction: Verbal/audio cues for subject awareness; force feedback for gentle handover.  
4. Emergency: Auto-stop on contact or anomaly; remote override.  
5. Task-specific: Pre-scan table for med packet; confirm subject position/vision aid.

D) Coverage report  
Features: Covered (terrain: floors/carpet; surfaces: walls; ambient: lighting; other: absent). Objects: Covered (0D: small items like football; 1D: absent; 2D: carpet; 3D: furniture/TV; immovable: walls/sofa; movable: chairs/clutter; non-agent moving: food/clothes). Agents: Covered (autonomous robots: Tiago; humans: subject; automatic: absent; animals: absent). All classes addressed; no stairs/doorways present.

E) Residual risk & SFAIRP  
Residual risks post-mitigations: Low (e.g., table interaction 16→4 via sensing; subject handover 15→3 via gentle protocols). Overall risk acceptable (max 4). SFAIRP: Mitigations (lidar limits, speed caps, verbal instructions) balance safety with task feasibility in cluttered indoor environment; further reductions (e.g., AI prediction) disproportionate to low likelihood.
