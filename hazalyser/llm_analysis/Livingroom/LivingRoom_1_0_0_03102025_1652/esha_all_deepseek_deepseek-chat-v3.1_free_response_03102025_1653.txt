B) Summary: Primary risks involve interactions with the highly fragile subject (Risk=15) and potential collisions with immovable objects (Risk=6多处). The environment contains typical household hazards like a fireplace and candle (Risks=4,5), with clutter and small objects posing trip and obstruction risks (Risk=6). The subject's mobility limitations and poor vision heighten consequences of any incidents.

C) Safety Requirements:
1. Maintain minimum 1m distance from subject unless performing assisted task
2. Implement force-limiting on all manipulator interactions (<5N force)
3. Use supplemental lighting in low-light conditions
4. Establish clear navigation paths free of small objects
5. Prohibit approach within 2m of open flame sources
6. Verify object recognition before manipulation attempts
7. Maintain constant lidar scanning with 360° coverage
8. Limit maximum speed to 0.3m/s in subject proximity

D) Coverage Report: All ESHA categories covered. Features: terrain (floors, walls), ambient (lighting). Objects: immovable (furniture), movable (clutter, items). Agents: human (subject). No automatic agents, animals, or other robots present. Non-mission interactions (general navigation) and mission interactions (medicine retrieval) both analyzed.

E) Residual Risk & SFAIRP: Residual risk remains moderate (Risk=10 for subject interaction) due to the fundamental challenge of safe physical interaction with a highly fragile individual. This is As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) given current assistive robot technology, as further risk reduction would require capabilities beyond state-of-the-art (e.g., predictive subject movement analysis, microscopic force control). Mitigations through sensor-based safeguards and operational constraints represent reasonable practicability.
