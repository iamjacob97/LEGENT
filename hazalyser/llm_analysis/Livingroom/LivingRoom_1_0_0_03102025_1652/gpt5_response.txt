# B) Summary and rationale

The critical hazards cluster around clutter (rugs, rolling ball, chairs), fragile or hazardous objects (wine bottle, glass, candles), and direct human interaction (handover to frail subject). The highest-risk items are the carpets (Risk 15), football (Risk 12), and subject handover (Risk 10). While walls, furniture, and electronics pose moderate risks, they primarily obstruct or cause secondary hazards. Residual fire hazard from candles remains notable.

# C) Safety requirements

1. **Environment preparation**

   * Remove rugs, toys, and fragile objects before task.
   * Push chairs and stools against perimeter walls.
   * Extinguish candles, unplug unstable electronics.

2. **Navigation and perception**

   * Maintain ≥0.5 m clear corridor near subject.
   * Detect rolling objects dynamically and replan.
   * Use task light and depth fusion to counter glare.

3. **Manipulation and handover**

   * Limit arm workspace, enforce tactile sensing.
   * Verify grasp on medicine only; avoid nearby objects.
   * Place items gently into subject’s hands or lap with voice cueing.

4. **Human oversight**

   * Caregiver supervises with manual E-stop.
   * Robot announces intended actions audibly.
   * Pre-task checklist ensures environmental readiness.

# D) Coverage report

* **Features:** Terrain (floor), surface features (carpets), ambient (lamps, light), structural immovable (walls).
* **Objects:** Fragile (wine, glass), hazardous small (candles), movable furniture (chairs, tables), non-agent moving (football), electronics (laptop).
* **Agents:** Autonomous robot (Tiago), human subject (elderly woman), caregiver bystander.
* **Absent:** No stairs, thresholds, or animals present.

# E) Residual risk & SFAIRP

Residual hazards after mitigations include sudden human motion, unpredictable rolling of small objects, and force-control faults during handover. Severity remains high due to subject frailty, but likelihood is reduced by pre-task removal, robust sensing, and caregiver oversight. Under SFAIRP, the residual package is acceptable if pre-task environment checks, low-speed motion, and supervised handover are consistently enforced.
