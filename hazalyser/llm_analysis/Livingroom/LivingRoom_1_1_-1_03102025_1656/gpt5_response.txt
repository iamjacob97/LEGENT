# B) Summary and rationale

The most critical risks are linked to **clutter and fragile objects (carpets, football, bottles, candles)** and **direct interaction with the frail subject**. Carpets pose the highest risk (15) due to wheelchair/robot tip-over potential. Dynamic rolling objects like the football (12) and fragile items (wine glasses, candles) introduce slip, fire, and burn hazards. The subject handover itself is inherently high risk (10) because of frailty and fall potential. Residual medium risks include navigation near walls, occluded electronics, and caregiver interference.

# C) Safety requirements

1. **Environment preparation**

   * Remove rugs, toys, candles, and fragile items pre-task.
   * Push chairs and stools against walls.
   * Secure or unplug electronics and cables.

2. **Navigation and perception**

   * Maintain ≥0.5 m clearance near subject and ≥0.3 m near furniture.
   * Detect rolling objects (football) dynamically.
   * Use task-lighting and lidar fusion in poor lighting.

3. **Manipulation and handover**

   * Restrict arm workspace to avoid fragile items.
   * Grasp medicines only, using vision+tactile confirmation.
   * Deliver at controlled speed with padded grippers.

4. **Human factors**

   * Provide audible cues before each robot motion.
   * Caregiver supervision with manual E-stop is mandatory.
   * Handover only to subject’s hands/lap harness points.

5. **Operational governance**

   * Pre-task checklist: clutter cleared, lighting adequate, candles extinguished, caregiver standby.
   * Post-task logging of incidents for safety audits.

# D) Coverage report

* **Features:** Terrain (floor), surface features (carpets), ambient (lighting), structural (walls).
* **Objects:** 0D/fragile (candles, glass, bottles), 1D/2D (cables, rugs), 3D immovable (tables, wardrobes, sofa), 3D movable (chairs, stools), non-agent moving (football).
* **Agents:** Autonomous robot (Tiago), humans (subject, caregiver).
* **Absent:** No animals, stairs, or external thresholds.

# E) Residual risk & SFAIRP

Residual hazards persist in:

* Force-control failures during handover,
* Unexpected caregiver or subject movement,
* Unremoved clutter introducing slip/fire hazards.

Severity remains high due to subject frailty, but likelihood is reduced through layered engineering safeguards, pre-task environmental preparation, and caregiver oversight. Residual risk is judged *as low as reasonably practicable* (SFAIRP) if checklists, supervision, and controlled robot behaviour are consistently enforced.
