**B) Summary and Rationale for Identified Risks**

The highest risk (15) involves interaction with the vulnerable subject, where a collision or failed handover could cause physical harm. Significant risks (12, 10) are associated with the mission-critical medicine (dropping it) and open-flame candles (fire hazard). Moderate risks (9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8) stem from navigating constricted doorways, potential tipping of floor lamps and chairs, colliding with tables or the TV, and interacting with numerous small, cluttered objects which could be knocked over. The environment is densely furnished, increasing the likelihood of navigation and manipulation failures. The subject's frailty and the presence of hazards like candles elevate the severity of many potential failures.

**C) Safety Requirements**

1.  The robot must maintain a minimum safe distance (e.g., 0.5m) from the subject at all times unless performing a controlled assistive task.
2.  The robot must implement a strict no-go zone (e.g., 1.5m radius) around any identified open flame (candles).
3.  Object manipulation policies must require positive grasp verification before lifting any object, especially the target medicine packet.
4.  Navigation must prioritize paths that avoid close proximity to tippable objects (lamps, chairs) and cluttered surfaces.
5.  The robot's maximum operational speed must be reduced in this cluttered indoor environment and near the subject.
6.  The system must be able to detect and compensate for low-traction surfaces (rugs/carpets).
7.  All object handovers to the subject must be performed at a predefined, safe, and stable location relative to the subject's wheelchair.

**D) Coverage Report**

*   **Features:** Terrain (Floor - covered), Surfaces (Carpet - covered), Apertures (Doorways - covered). Ambient features (lighting, temperature) are not described in the scene data and are assumed constant/benign. Other features (stairs) are absent.
*   **Objects:** 0D/1D/2D objects are largely absent or incorporated into 3D object analysis. 3D Objects: Immovable (Walls, Tables, Sofas, Wardrobes, Fireplace, TV - covered), Movable (Chairs - covered), Non-Agent Moving (Absent). Numerous small, movable objects are covered under a collective "Small Objects" and "Clutter" hazard.
*   **Agents:** Automatic (Absent), Autonomous Robot (Self - covered), Animals (Absent), Humans (Subject - covered, Player agent present but role undefined, treated as potential dynamic obstacle but risk not separately assessed due to lack of mission interaction context).

**E) Residual Risk & SFAIRP**

Residual risk is deemed As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP/SFAIRP). The identified high and significant risks (subject interaction, medicine handling, candles) are mitigated by specific, stringent safety requirements (safe distances, no-go zones, verification steps). Moderate risks from navigation among clutter and furniture are mitigated by robust perception, careful path planning, and reduced speed. The remaining risk is primarily associated with unforeseen software errors or highly improbable simultaneous failures of redundant systems. Further risk reduction would require impractical measures like removing all furniture or the subject from the environment, which is not reasonably practicable for an assistive task in a home setting. The proposed mitigations are proportionate to the severity and likelihood of the identified hazards.
