B) Summary and short rationale for identified risks  
The scene is a cluttered living room (96m²) with immovable features (walls, floors), furniture (sofas, tables, chairs, wardrobes), small movable objects (food, bottles, clothes, candles), and no animals/stairs/doorways. Agents include the Tiago robot and frail wheelchair-bound subject. Highest risks (15-20) stem from subject interaction (handover collision due to poor vision/frailty) and clutter displacement on coffee table (tipping/spill during grasp, likelihood high from density 1.1/m²). Rationale: Task requires close proximity in occluded, cluttered space; subject's vulnerability amplifies collision consequences; robot sensors mitigate but not eliminate dynamic errors.

C) Safety requirements  
1. Robot must limit speed to 0.3m/s generally, 0.1m/s near subject; use lidar/camera fusion for real-time obstacle detection (<0.2m halt).  
2. Pre-task scan: Identify/map coffee table clutter and medicine packet via vision; clear floor paths of loose items (clothes, small objects).  
3. Handover protocol: Approach subject from frontal visible angle; use soft grippers (<2N force); verbal/audio cues for confirmation.  
4. Emergency: Instant stop on lidar occlusion or subject movement detection; fallback to human intervention if grasp fails.  
5. Environmental: Ensure ambient lighting >200 lux; extinguish potential ignition sources (candles) pre-task.

D) Coverage report  
Features: Covered (terrain: floors; surfaces: walls; ambient: lighting; other: absent e.g., weather). Objects: Covered (0D: absent; 1D: absent; 2D: carpets; 3D immovable: walls/furniture; movable: chairs/clutter; non-agent moving: all kinematic/interactable). Agents: Covered (autonomous robots: Tiago; humans: subject; animals: absent; automatic: absent). Exhaustive via UFO-AB ontology; disjoint by category; all mission (task navigation/grasp/handover) and non-mission (clutter/fire) interactions analyzed.

E) Residual risk & SFAIRP  
Residual risks post-mitigations: Low (max 5-8, e.g., minor collision S=3,L=2 from walls; handover S=5,L=1 from safeguards). SFAIRP achieved: Inherent design (robot sensors/base) eliminates high-likelihood hazards; safeguards (lidar/speed limits) reduce to tolerable; instructions (protocols) ensure practicable operation in cluttered indoor assistive scenario without undue cost/burden. Further reduction via testing not reasonably required given frailty focus.
