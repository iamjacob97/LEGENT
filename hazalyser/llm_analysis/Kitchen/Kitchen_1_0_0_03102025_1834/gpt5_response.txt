# B) Summary and rationale

The highest risks arise from **handover of the hot coffee cup (Risk 15)** and **direct interaction with the frail subject (Risk 15)**, where even minor failures can result in severe burns or falls. Other notable risks include **heat sources (oven/hob, Risk 10)**, **robot control faults (Risk 10)**, and **movable clutter (chairs, small food items, Risk 6)**. Fragile objects (plants, vase) and bins present low to moderate risks but can escalate if they create slip hazards.

---

# C) Safety requirements

1. **Environment preparation**

   * Remove or relocate fragile items, small clutter, and chairs away from paths.
   * Position bin against wall and extinguish hot appliances before assistive task.

2. **Navigation and perception**

   * Maintain ≥0.5 m clearance corridors near subject.
   * Use lidar for reliable mapping, avoid occlusions from tables and clutter.
   * Monitor ambient lighting, enable robot’s task-light.

3. **Manipulation and handover**

   * Transport hot cup in spill-proof holder or tray.
   * Enforce low-speed delivery with padded grippers and tactile sensing.
   * Place cup on stable surface near subject rather than directly in hand.

4. **Human factors**

   * Caregiver must supervise with E-stop access.
   * Provide clear audio prompts before motion and during handover.

5. **Operational governance**

   * Pre-task checklist for floor clearance, clutter removal, appliance shutdown.
   * Post-task logging of near-misses, cup handling errors, and environment conditions.

# D) Coverage report

* **Features:** Floor, walls, ambient lighting.
* **Objects:** 0D/fragile (plants, vase), 3D immovable (tables, oven, refrigerator, washer), 3D movable (chairs, stool, bin), small hazardous (hot cup).
* **Agents:** Autonomous robot (Tiago), human subject (elderly woman), caregiver bystander.
* **Absent:** No animals, no automatic agents, no doorways/stairs.

# E) Residual risk & SFAIRP

Residual hazards remain in the inherently high-risk coffee handover task due to the subject’s frailty and hot liquid. Likelihood is reduced by using a spill-proof holder, low-speed control, and caregiver oversight. Burns and falls remain severe consequences, but mitigations reduce them to *as low as reasonably practicable*. Provided pre-task checklists, environmental preparation, and supervised handover are consistently applied, the residual package satisfies SFAIRP.
