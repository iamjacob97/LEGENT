B) Summary and Rationale:
Primary risks stem from human-robot interaction (Risk=15) due to subject's high frailty and mobility limitations. Food handling presents moderate risk (9) from potential hot liquid spills. All other hazards show controlled risks (2-9) through standard mitigations. The environment contains typical kitchen hazards (thermal, fragile objects) requiring specific avoidance protocols.

C) Safety Requirements:
1. Maintain minimum 1.5m distance from subject during movements
2. Implement thermal sensing with 0.5m keep-out zones around hob/oven
3. Force limits not exceeding 50N on all manipulator interactions
4. Maximum speed 0.3m/s in subject proximity
5. Liquid container handling must include spill-proof grips
6. Continuous subject tracking with redundant sensors
7. Emergency stop within 0.5s of collision detection

D) Coverage Report:
All ESHA categories addressed: Features (terrain: floors/walls, ambient), Objects (immovable: appliances, movable: chairs/food, fragile: glassware), Agents (human subject). No automatic agents or animals present. 100% coverage of scene elements achieved.

E) Residual Risk & SFAIRP:
Residual risk reduced to ALARP through implemented mitigations. Highest residual risk remains in human-robot interaction (Risk=6 after safeguards) due to subject's extreme vulnerability. All risks meet SFAIRP criteria through: 1) Inherent design (stable surfaces, clear pathways), 2) Engineering controls (sensors, force limits), 3) Administrative controls (speed limits, procedures), and 4) Emergency protocols (stops, alerts). No further practicable risk reduction identified.
