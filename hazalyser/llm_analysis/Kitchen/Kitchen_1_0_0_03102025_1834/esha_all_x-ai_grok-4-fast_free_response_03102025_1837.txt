B) Summary and short rationale for identified risks  
The scene is a cluttered kitchen (89.79 m², clutter density 0.646/m²) with immovable features (walls, floor), appliances (refrigerator, hob, oven, washer), furniture (tables, chairs), and movable objects (food items, cup, plants, bin). Agents include the Tiago robot performing the task and the frail, wheelchair-bound subject. Key risks stem from the task's hot liquid handling in a dense environment: high-severity spills/burns (S=5, e.g., coffee handover, L=4 due to subject's frailty and clutter); collisions/tipping (S=4, L=3-4 from narrow paths and movable chairs); lower risks from ambient/immovable items (S=2-3, L=1-2, mitigated by design). Rationale: Frail subject's vulnerability amplifies consequences; robot's lidar/arms reduce likelihood but clutter/occlusion increases it; no stairs/doorways, but no animals/automatic agents present.

C) Safety requirements  
1. Robot must detect and avoid all objects with >0.3m clearance using lidar/vision fusion.  
2. Grasp hot coffee with temperature-verified grip (<60°C) and stable two-arm hold.  
3. Approach subject at <0.1 m/s, from visible front, with voice/haptic alerts.  
4. Dynamically map clutter; pause if instability (e.g., chair tip) detected.  
5. Emergency stop integration for spills/collisions; post-task verification of subject safety.  
6. Pre-task scan for hot sources (hob, oven) and clear paths.

D) Coverage report  
- Features: Covered (terrain: floor; surfaces: walls; ambient: indoor kitchen; other: none).  
- Objects: Covered (0D: food items; 1D: none; 2D: none; 3D: appliances, furniture, small movables; immovable: walls/appliances; movable: chairs/plants/bin/food; non-agent moving: all objects).  
- Agents: Covered (automatic: none; autonomous robots: Tiago; animals: absent; humans: subject, player noted but low-risk). All classes addressed; exhaustive via ontological grouping (UFO-AB: situations, objects, agents); disjoint by category.

E) Residual risk & SFAIRP  
Residual risks post-mitigations: Low (max Risk=5-8, e.g., minor spill from unforeseen clutter; overall <10 via safeguards). SFAIRP achieved: Inherent designs (e.g., robot base) and instructions (e.g., speed limits) eliminate high risks reasonably; further reductions (e.g., decluttering) impractical without altering scene; lidar/sensors provide exhaustive coverage for assistive task in frail interaction context.
