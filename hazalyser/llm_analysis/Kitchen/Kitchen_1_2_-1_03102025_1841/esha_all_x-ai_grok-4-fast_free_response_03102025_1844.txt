B) Summary and short rationale for identified risks  
The scene is a cluttered kitchen (1.0 items/m²) with immovable features (walls, floor, appliances) posing collision/entrapment risks, movable objects (chairs, utensils, food) increasing occlusion/tipping hazards, and agents (robot, frail subject) amplifying interaction vulnerabilities during hot coffee retrieval/handover. Highest risks (15-16) stem from hot liquid spills/burns due to clutter-induced navigation errors and frail subject's poor vision/mobility, rationalized by task demands in dense, heat-prone environment; lower risks (4-6) from minor clutter like plants.

C) Safety requirements  
1. Robot must limit speed to 0.2 m/s in clutter, 0.1 m/s near subject; use lidar/vision for real-time obstacle avoidance and thermal checks on coffee (<60°C).  
2. Handover protocol: Announce intent, position arm at wheelchair height (0.7m), apply <3N force, confirm grasp release via vision/force sensors.  
3. Pre-task: Clear 0.5m path to counter/subject; verify no spills/hot surfaces.  
4. Emergency: Instant halt on lidar detection of subject movement or temp anomaly; log all interactions for post-task review.  
5. Subject-specific: Adapt for frailty—avoid sudden motions, provide verbal/audio cues for low vision.

D) Coverage report  
Features: Covered (terrain: floor; surfaces: walls/appliances; ambient: heat; other: absent). Objects: Covered (0D: absent; 1D: utensils; 2D: absent; 3D: tables/chairs/appliances/food; immovable: walls/appliances; movable: chairs/food; non-agent moving: all objects). Agents: Covered (autonomous robots: Tiago; humans: subject/player; automatic: absent; animals: absent). All ESHA classes addressed; no gaps in mission (coffee task) or non-mission (general navigation) interactions.

E) Residual risk & SFAIRP  
Residual risks post-mitigations: Low (max 6-8 from clutter slips or minor collisions), as inherent designs (omnidirectional base, sensors) and safeguards (lidar/thermal) reduce likelihood to 1-2, while instructions ensure procedural compliance. SFAIRP achieved: Hazards exhaustively enumerated via UFO-AB ontology; mitigations balanced cost/effectiveness (e.g., software replanning over hardware mods); risks ALARP given robot capabilities and subject frailty, with no reasonably practicable further reductions without task infeasibility.
