**B) Summary and Rationale for Identified Risks**

The highest risks (Risk=15) involve direct interaction with the highly vulnerable subject and handling of hot liquids. A spill during coffee handover could cause severe burns, and any physical collision could lead to a fall or injury due to the subject's frailty. Chair-related hazards (Risk=12) are significant due to their mobility and potential to cause falls or entrapment. General navigation among clutter and immovable objects presents moderate risks (6-9), mitigated by robust sensing but ever-present due to the confined kitchen environment.

**C) Safety Requirements**

1.  The robot must perform a temperature check on any liquid container before attempted handover.
2.  A forced-reduced speed zone must be established within a 1.5m radius of the subject.
3.  Object manipulation motions near the subject must be pre-computed for minimal jerk and maximum stability.
4.  The robot's navigation system must classify and dynamically update the positions of all movable objects (chairs).
5.  A two-step verification (sensor + algorithm) must confirm a stable grip on the target cup before lifting.
6.  The system must include a clear, immediate verbal and auditory emergency stop signal usable by the subject.

*   **ESHA Classes:** All applicable classes for an indoor kitchen scene are addressed. The analysis is exhaustive for the provided scene elements.

**E) Residual Risk & SFAIRP**

Residual risk is deemed As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). The identified high-severity risks (subject interaction, hot liquid handling) are mitigated by specific, verifiable technical and procedural safeguards (temperature checks, reduced speed zones, stable grip verification). The likelihood of these high-consequence events is reduced to a level where the cost or effort to reduce it further would be grossly disproportionate to the minimal risk reduction achieved. The remaining moderate and low risks are controlled to a level acceptable for the intended assistive operation in a domestic environment.
