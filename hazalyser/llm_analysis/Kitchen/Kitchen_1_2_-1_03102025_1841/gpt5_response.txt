# B) Summary & Rationale

The **dominant hazards** are linked to **cluttered environment** and **direct human interaction**. The **coffee handover** (Risk 20) and **cluttered tables/food items** (Risk 20) pose the greatest risks because of high severity (burns, slips, contamination) and elevated likelihood in dense environments. Robot–subject interaction (Risk 15) remains inherently high-risk due to frailty. Other risks stem from **fragile items breaking** (Risk 12), **movable chairs occluding navigation** (Risk 12), and **appliance surfaces** (Risk 10).

# C) Safety Requirements

1. **Environmental preparation**:

   * Remove loose clutter (cups, food, bottles) from robot’s navigation corridor.
   * Relocate fragile objects (glass, plants, vases) away from active areas.
   * Push chairs against walls; keep bin/furniture out of central pathways.

2. **Robot navigation/perception**:

   * Maintain safe corridor width ≥0.5 m.
   * Use dynamic replanning to avoid movable clutter.
   * Apply sensor fusion (lidar + vision) for reliable obstacle detection.

3. **Manipulation/handover**:

   * Use cup holders or trays for hot liquid transport.
   * Execute low-speed handover to stable surface near subject rather than directly into her hand.
   * Ensure tactile/voice cues for subject before interaction.

4. **Human factors**:

   * Require caregiver presence with access to emergency stop.
   * Robot must audibly announce actions before moving or handing over items.

5. **Governance & safety assurance**:

   * Apply pre-task checklist for clutter clearance, appliance shutdown.
   * Post-task event logging for near-misses and object drops.

# D) Coverage Report

* **Features:** Floor, walls, ambient clutter.
* **Objects:** Immovable (tables, appliances, counters), Movable (chairs, bins), Fragile (glass, vases, plants), Small hazardous (hot cup, food).
* **Agents:** Autonomous robot (Tiago), frail elderly subject, caregiver.
* **Absent:** Animals, automatic devices, stairs/doorways.

# E) Residual Risk & SFAIRP

Residual risks remain concentrated in **handover of hot liquids** and **dense clutter environments**. Severity cannot be eliminated but likelihood is reduced through **tray-based handover, supervised delivery, and clutter clearance**. With proper safeguards and caregiver oversight, residual risk is **as low as reasonably practicable (SFAIRP)** for domestic assistive settings.
