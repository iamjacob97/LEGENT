All items are rated on a **5-point Likert scale** unless otherwise indicated:
1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly Agree.
## Section A. **Content Accuracy and Reliability**

1. The hazards identified by the system are **factually grounded in the scene description**.
    
2. The analysis includes the **most critical hazards** relevant to the task and environment.
    
3. The **severity and likelihood ratings** are reasonable and consistent with the hazards described.
    
4. The analysis avoids mentioning **hazards not supported by the scene context** (hallucinations).
    
5. The hazard list is **non-redundant** (few repeated or duplicate entries).

## Section B. **Explanation Quality**


6. Explanations are **specific to the scene context**, referencing concrete objects and spatial relations.
    
7. Explanations provide a **causal or temporal account** (e.g., preconditions or sequences that could lead to the hazard).
    
8. The outputs include **clear and actionable safeguards or instructions**.
    
9. The hazard descriptions are **concise and free of irrelevant details**.
    
10. The explanation structure makes it **easy to follow the reasoning process** of the system.

11. I would find this hazard analysis **useful for supporting safety assessment** in assistive robotics.
    
12. The outputs are **easy to interpret and understand** without further clarification.
    
13. I would feel **confident relying on these results** in a real hazard analysis task.
    
14. The system provides a **balanced level of detail**, neither overwhelming nor superficial.
